Welcome,
This program compute the equation Hx=b, where H is the Hilbert matrix and b is a vector whose elements are all 1s. The project consist of two header files and one .cpp file. The main.cpp source file already include two header files. Simply execute the main.cpp with GUN G++ compiler.
When the prompt comes out, the program takes in one single input n, which determine the size of the H matrix. The program continue to ask for the next input unless ‘q’ is typed in. 
To change the data type of the element value. You have to go to the two header file and find the statement “using type=long double;” in the beginning of the file and change it into “using type = float ” or any data type you like.
